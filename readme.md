Estimating Weekly Returns:

To estimate the potential weekly returns, we'll consider both the best-case and worst-case scenarios, along with some probability estimates.

Assumptions:

1. Historical Volatility:

High-volume stocks can experience significant price movements.

We'll assume potential weekly price changes of ±5% for these stocks.



2. Investment Distribution:

Total investment: $50.

Investment per stock: Approximately $16.67.



3. No Transaction Costs:

For simplicity, we'll ignore brokerage fees and taxes.




Best-Case Scenario (+5% Weekly Gain):

Per Stock Gain:

Gain per stock: $16.67 * 5% = $0.83.


Total Weekly Gain:

Total gain: $0.83 * 3 stocks = $2.49.


Portfolio Value After One Week:

Total value: $50 + $2.49 = $52.49.



Worst-Case Scenario (-5% Weekly Loss):

Per Stock Loss:

Loss per stock: $16.67 * 5% = $0.83.


Total Weekly Loss:

Total loss: $0.83 * 3 stocks = $2.49.


Portfolio Value After One Week:

Total value: $50 - $2.49 = $47.51.



Expected Scenario (Average Market Conditions):

Average Weekly Return:

Historically, the stock market averages about 0.15% weekly growth.


Per Stock Gain:

Gain per stock: $16.67 * 0.15% ≈ $0.025.


Total Weekly Gain:

Total gain: $0.025 * 3 stocks ≈ $0.075.


Portfolio Value After One Week:

Total value: $50 + $0.075 ≈ $50.08.



Probability Estimates:

High Probability (±1% Change):

Stocks are likely to move within ±1% in a stable market.

Potential gain or loss per stock: $0.17.

Total portfolio change: ±$0.51.


Moderate Probability (±5% Change):

There's a moderate chance of stocks moving ±5% due to earnings reports or market news.

As calculated above.


Low Probability (±10% or More Change):

Significant market events could cause larger swings.

Potential gain or loss per stock: $1.67.

Total portfolio change: ±$5.



Risk Assessment:

Best-Case High Gain (Low Probability):

If a stock surges due to exceptional news (e.g., a 20% increase):

Gain per stock: $16.67 * 20% = $3.33.

Total gain: $3.33 * 3 stocks = $9.99.

Portfolio value: $59.99.



Worst-Case High Loss (Low Probability):

If a stock plummets due to bad news (e.g., a 20% decrease):

Loss per stock: $16.67 * 20% = $3.33.

Total loss: $3.33 * 3 stocks = $9.99.

Portfolio value: $40.01.




Summary Table:

Considerations and Recommendations:

1. Small Capital Limitation:

With only $50, the potential gains and losses are relatively small in absolute terms.

Transaction costs can significantly impact returns if not accounted for.



2. Market Volatility:

Stock prices can be unpredictable, especially in short time frames like a week.

External factors (earnings reports, economic data, geopolitical events) can influence stock performance.



3. Diversification:

Investing in only 3 stocks concentrates risk.

Consider diversifying into more stocks or using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to spread risk.



4. Risk Management:

Implement stop-loss orders to limit potential losses.

Set target prices for taking profits.



5. Research and Analysis:

Perform fundamental and technical analysis on selected stocks.

Monitor news and market sentiment related to these stocks.



6. Probabilities:

The stock market doesn't guarantee returns.

The probabilities of the best and worst-case scenarios are difficult to quantify without in-depth statistical analysis.



7. Long-Term Perspective:

Short-term trading can be more volatile.

Consider a longer investment horizon for potentially more stable returns.

Conclusion:

Best-Case Scenario:

You could potentially earn around $2.49 in a week, representing a 5% return on your $50 investment.

This scenario assumes favorable market movements.


Expected Scenario:

Under normal market conditions, expect minimal gains of about $0.08 in a week.


Worst-Case Scenario:

You might lose approximately $2.49, a 5% loss, if the market moves against you.


Extreme Scenarios:

Significant gains or losses are possible but less probable within a week.



Final Thoughts:

Trading with a small amount like $50 is a good way to learn about the stock market without risking substantial capital.

Always be cautious and conduct thorough research.

Remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.
